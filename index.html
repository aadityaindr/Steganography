            Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography is a technique for hiding information within digital media by modifying the least significant bits of pixel values. Here's a brief overview of how it works:
            Data Preparation: Convert the secret message or data into a binary format. This data is then divided into smaller segments or bytes to be embedded into the cover image.
            Image Analysis: The cover image is analyzed to determine where the bits of the message will be embedded. Typically, this involves selecting the least significant bits of each pixel value in the image.
            Embedding Data: For each bit of the secret message, the least significant bit of the corresponding pixel's color component is modified. The least significant bit is the rightmost bit in a binary representation of the pixel value, which has the smallest impact on the overall color.
            Image Modification: The changes made to the LSBs are subtle and generally imperceptible to the human eye, ensuring that the image appears unchanged despite the hidden data.
            Data Extraction: To retrieve the hidden message, the LSBs of the pixel values are read from the image. The extracted bits are then reassembled to reconstruct the original message.
